# AR-Video-Player
When pointed towards a assigned target a screen will appear floating above target on which a video can be played.
It was created using unity version 2017.1.0f3(64bit) and vuforia sdk.
Built as a birthday gift for my brother, so the screen will play a happy birthday video. 
The target that is being currently used is a 100 rs note that can be easily changed as per requirement.
Currently only works in editor mode as some functions used for playing video are not supported on android or ios but there are other ways to  play videos like sampling the video or using some oculus api that can be used instead of current functions after that an android or ios app can be built .

Screenshots of the app are attached
